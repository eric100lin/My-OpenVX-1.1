 * \brief The Khronos Extension for Kernel Variants.
 *
 * \defgroup group_variants Extension: Kernel Variants
 * \brief The Khronos Extension for Kernel Variants.
 * \details Kernel Variants allow the Client-Defined Functions to create several
 * kernels on the same target with the same name, but with slight variations
 * between them. Frequently these variants are expected to employ different
 * algorithms or methodologies.
 *
 * All target specific kernels and target variants must conform to the same OpenVX
 * specification of the OpenVX Kernel in order to use the string name and enumeration.
 * For example, a vendor may supply multiple targets,
 * and implement the same functionality on each. Futhermore the same
 * vendor may offer a variant on some specific target which offers some differentiation but
 * still  conforms to the definition of the OpenVX Kernel.
 * In this example there are 3 implementations of the same computer vision function, "Sobel3x3".
 * \arg On "CPU" a "Sobel3x3" which is "faster". A variant which may produce slightly less accurate but still conformant results.
 * \arg On "CPU" a "Sobel3x3" which is more "accurate". A variant which may run slower but produces bit exact results.
 * \arg On "GPU" a "Sobel3x3" \e default variant which may run on a remote core and produce bit exact results.
 *
 * In each of the cases a client of OpenVX could request the kernels in nearly
 * the same the same manner. There are two main approaches, which depend on the
 * method a client calls to get the kernel reference. The first uses enumerations.
 * \snippet examples/vx_kernels.c firstmethod
 * This method allows to client to attempt to find other targets and variants, but if
 * these are not present, the default node would still have been constructed.
 * The second method depends on using fully qualified strings to get the kernel reference.
 * \snippet examples/vx_kernels.c secondmethod
 * This second method is more compact but is does not permit fail-safing to default versions.
 *
 * As part of this extension, the function <tt>vxGetKernelByName</tt> will now accept more
 * qualifications to the string naming scheme. Kernels names can be additionally
 * qualified in 2 separate ways, by target and by variant. A "fully" qualified name is in the format of
 * <i>target</i><b>:</b><i>kernel</i><b>:</b><i>variant</i>.
 * Both \e target and \e variant may be omitted (for an unqualified name).
 * In this case, the implementation will assume the "default" value of these
 * names (which could literally be "default"). Names may also be fully
 * qualified with target included.
 * Examples:
 * \arg "khronos.c_model:org.khonos.openvx.sobel3x3:default" - fully qualified
 * \arg "org.khronos.openvx.sobel3x3:default" (missing target) - partially qualified
 * \arg "khronos.c_model:org.khronos.openvx.sobel3x3" (missing variant) - partially qualifed.
 * \arg "org.khronos.openvx.sobel3x3" - unqualified.
